eHealthBook

eHealthBook is a web-based application which is used to capture, organize, maintain and retrieve patient’s medical records on day-to-day basis. This application consists of a comprehensive database used to store and access patients’ healthcare information. The major goal of the EMR is to serve as a repository for the clinical observations and analysis of the patient. It contains modules like Authentication, Document management, Event management, Access management and Encryption.


User can upload, update, view or delete the data , data can be in image or pdf format. User can give access to information about user’s health history to the doctor, the information such as prescriptions, test reports, daily health related events and it can be seen by doctors who are taking care of a patient and can be used by them to make recommendations about the patient’s health. And through access management user can track the access given to doctors with current status.

On the backend to manage the business logic and databases we have used the spring boot with MySQL database. For transaction management and databases operations Hibernate and JPA are used. On the frontend the technologies like Html, css and JavaScript are used in the JSP.
